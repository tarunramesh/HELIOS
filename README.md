## Description
The project aims to leverage artificial intelligence and computer vision to detect and report unauthorized hoardings and billboards in Bengaluru. This initiative aligns with the goal of ensuring compliance with city regulations and enhancing urban aesthetics.

---

## Problem Statement
Bengaluru faces challenges related to the proliferation of illegal hoardings and billboards, which not only violate city regulations but also contribute to visual pollution. This project seeks to address these issues by developing a robust system capable of accurately identifying and reporting unauthorized outdoor advertisements.

---

## Dataset Creation
A comprehensive dataset was created, comprising images of hoardings from both legal and unauthorized locations across Bengaluru. Annotations were meticulously marked to facilitate training of the YOLOv8 model for precise object detection.

---

## Technology Stack
- YOLOv8 for object detection
- Streamlit for frontend interface development
- Telegram bot for user interaction and reporting
- SQLite for database management
- Python for backend development and model training

---

## Project Workflow
1. Data Collection and Annotation
2. YOLOv8 Model Training and Optimization
3. Frontend Development using Streamlit
4. Integration of YOLOv8 Model into Frontend Interface
5. Development and Integration of Telegram Bot
6. Implementation of Reward System for User Engagement

---

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the necessary environment and dependencies using requirements.txt.
3. Run the Streamlit app using streamlit run app.py to access the frontend interface.
4. Interact with the Telegram bot to report unauthorized hoardings and receive updates.
